#program fpugraph.c

This is a simple program creating a 2D plot, done with plotter like graphics technique, 
using geometric primitives, circles, points, lines, segments, can be plotted and labels can be added. 
It is pure c code and can be compiled on unix/linux gcc and mingw gcc, 
you need to compile the libplot gnu plotutils library and link to them.
See that when you are able to compute functions and
 plot parabola, hyperbola, circles and ellipsis and do floating point (double) real number 
computations (and even complex numbers, as couples of double) 
you can do everything about orbits, and related explanation graphics.
some part can be a bit cryptic, since the function name of libplot libraries 
are not so easy to understand soon the meaning, 
but I will try to improve readibility with higher level functions and explicative names.

it uses plotter-like functions not so different from postcript calls and also
something similar to the turtle graphics many people have seen an tried on python examples 
coloured country of the world flags plot and other, 
but using c language it is much more efficient and fast in producing graphics 
and doing math computations in the same portion of code as well.
Turtle graphics is very easy to understand, that's why it is used also to teach computing to kids, 
in any case vectorial graphics it is quite important and used also in many applications, 
included science.
